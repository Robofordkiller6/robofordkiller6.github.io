# Personal Website

This project is a very simple portfolio in which gets updated in time with my growing knowledge in the tech field. Its goal is to inform any visitor about myself.

## Description

At the start of my tech jounrey with The Tech Academy we were tasked to create our own portfolio, in which we can showcase our growing skills. As we learn more in the future
the website will also be added with more details and goals. It will also hopefully showcase further skills and projects that I have worked on as time goes on.
